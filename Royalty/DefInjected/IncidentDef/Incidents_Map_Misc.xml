  <!-- EN: A {PAWN_title} named {PAWN_nameDef} came to join you, but has collapsed nearby due to {HEDIFF_label}.\n\n[PAWN_pronoun] is willing to contribute once {PAWN_pronoun} has recovered, but will not leave voluntarily. If you don't want {PAWN_nameDef}, you can banish {PAWN_objective}, sell {PAWN_objective} into slavery or leave {PAWN_objective} to die. However, your other colonists may find this disturbing. -->
